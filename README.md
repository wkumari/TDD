# IETF Technology Deep Dives (TDD) Planning 

This is the working area for IETF Technology Deep Dives (TDD) Planning.

It is intended for use by TDD coordinators, TDD panelists, and IESG TDD sponsors. 

TDDs are cross-area presentations, organized by the IESG, and held in conjunction with [IETF meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/).

The characteristics of TDDs are that they 
 * focus on cross-area topics
 * explain ways that IETF standards can be used
 * explain ways that these standards can be misused, based on partial understandings
 * can also provide feedback to IETF working groups responsible for these standards, and to other IETF working groups

Past TDD sessions are included in [IETF Meeting Proceedings](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tdd/meetings/). Like all IETF meetings, they are also archived on the [IETF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ietf).
